# Hi, I’m Nisha 👋

I’m a software engineer building AI-powered products and scalable web systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of frontend, backend, and applied AI — turning complex ideas into clean, usable tools.

### What I work on
- AI-driven applications using LLMs, RAG pipelines, and real-time inference
- Full-stack systems with React, TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, and Python
- Developer tools, internal platforms, and learning systems
- Performance-focused frontend interfaces and scalable APIs

### Experience & focus
- Building and shipping production-ready AI systems used by students and teams
- Designing clean system architectures with authentication, role-based access, and observability
- Strong interest in frontend performance, UX clarity, and end-to-end ownership

### Tech I use often
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Redux, MUI  
**Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), Node.js  
**AI / Data:** LLM APIs, RAG, vector databases  
**Infra:** Docker, CI/CD, cloud deployments  
**Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL

### Current interests
- Applied AI in real products  
- Frontend performance and design systems  
- Developer experience and tooling  
- Building things that scale and last
